# NSG-Patient-Anatomy-App


In an attempt to improve upon our knowledge of the utilization of 3D models in the care of men and women, as well as aid in their understanding of the complicated procedures of the UF Shands Neurosurgery Department, we seek to develop a novel patient education application. This application will include the creation of patient-specific 3D anatomical models that can display the specific pathology at hand to allow the physician to educate the patient on their condition in hopes of improved understanding of the underlying pathophysiology. This will also provide the physician with an opportunity to elucidate the surgical technique that will be employed and discuss possible complications of the procedure.
